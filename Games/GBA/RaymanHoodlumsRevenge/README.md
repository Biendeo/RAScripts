## Overview

Rayman: Hoodlums' Revenge is a platform game developed by Backbone Entertainment and published by Ubisoft for the Game Boy Advance in 2005. It was the first Rayman game to be a isometric platformer and was set after Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc. Taking place supposedly a short while after the events in Rayman 3, the game begins with Rayman and Globox sleeping in the Fairy Council, when Globox's dreams are disturbed by the memory of him swallowing the Black Lum Andr√©. He is awakened by a strange sound, and goes off to search for its source. Later, Rayman awakens up to find that Globox is missing, and goes off to look for him. Play as both Rayman and Globox through eleven levels, four bosses, and five bonus levels on your quest to stop the Hoodlums return.

## Set Design

### Achievements

#### Progression

There exists one achievement for each of the 4 in-game bosses. The three leading up to the final boss are progression achievements and are worth 5 points each.

#### Game Completion

The game is completed when the final boss in Reflux's Lair is defeated (worth 25 points).

#### Boss Challenge

Each of the 4 bosses has a challenge achievement related to it, each worth 5 points.

#### Per Level

Each level of the game contains one achievement for beating the level in a certain amount of time. For non-boss levels, there also exists an achievement for beating the level with all the lums. For all levels with a score, there exists an achievement for beating the level with a score to achieve 3 stamps (in-game determined). Finally, for all levels with 4 Teensies (the Bog of Murk level is excluded as it has 6 and all of them are required to continue), an achievement exists for collecting all of them and beating the level.

#### Miscellaneous

There's also one last achievement for having a combo score of 5000 at some point in the game.

### Leaderboards

There is a leaderboard for each level for the highest score (only for levels that show your score), and one for each level for the quickest finish (all levels).

### Rich Presence

The rich presence lists your current character, level, health, Teensies, and lums.
