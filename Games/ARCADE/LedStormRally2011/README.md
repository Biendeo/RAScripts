## Overview

Led Storm Rally 2011 is an earlier version of the Led Storm and Mad Gear arcade games. Play from a top-down perspective as you drive at speeds around 300kmh through 9 levels, dodging obstacles, picking up fuel, and stopping your opponent whose name seems to be Led Storm in this version. And witness some hilarious broken English from time to time.

## Set Design

### Game Flow Description

The game's levels are as such:

```
Capital
Netwood Forest
Coral Sea
Big Cave Tunnel
Ruins Desert
Millon Valley
Thunder Road
Marine Snow Pipeway
SkyCity.009
```

Once the final level is cleared, the player can Ghost & Goblins style play through the whole game again (the game hard stops after the second playthrough). If the player loses all their energy in any level, they can retry the level from the beginning, resetting their score.

### Achievements

#### Levels

There is one achievement for beating each level in the game (18 including the repeat levels). A credits screen can be seen after level 9, so the progression achievements and win condition only have to go up to that point.

#### Score

To test the player can get through the game without continues the following score achievements exist:
- Get to 1,000,000 points.
- Get to 2,000,000 points (this beats the leaderboards).
- Get to 5,000,000 points (this is probably a test that the player can beat the whole game without continues).

#### Time

For each level (1 through 9, repeat levels use the same time so they can count for the same achievement), the _Today's Bests_ times at the end of the level must be met or beaten. This is:
- Capital: `1:36.87`
- Netwood Forest - `1:39.22`
- Coral Sea - `1:37.32`
- Big Cave Tunnel - `1:36.29`
- Ruins Desert - `1:38.48`
- Millon Valley - `1:37.55`
- Thunder Road - `1:35.59`
- Marine Snow Pipeway - `1:46.74`
- SkyCity.009 - `1:40.00` (this doesn't show up in game so this is just a time I set)

#### Miscellaneous

The following are also special achievements:
- Collect 6 fuel cans to get a turbo boost
- Run out of energy but then regain some more either by a checkpoint or an energy pickup
- Witness some secret credits by having one credit in the machine when beating level 18
- Something to do with losing the race? I can't trigger it.

### Leaderboards

There is a leaderboard for each level's time (9 leaderboards), and one for the score achieved once entering the leaderboard entry screen.
