## Set Design

### Achievements

#### Progression and Win Condition

There is no progression or win condition with this set, each achievement is its own challenge.

#### Per Song

Each of the 37 songs has three achievements:
- Beating the easy score on any difficulty.
- Beating the hard score on the hard difficulty (which is **always** 720 points less).
- Getting a phrase bonus on 75% (rounded up) of the song's phrases.
    - A phrase bonus is acquired when the player gets a cool rated phrase while their star bar is at least 80% full, and the player will get phrase bonus points for doing so.

### Leaderboards

There are six leaderboards per song, one for combination of difficulty and short/normal length. This equates to 222 leaderboards total.

### Rich Presence

The rich presence when in a song in Sing Mode displays to the following format:

```
[SPA] Singing Sin Documentos by Los Rodríguez - Difficulty: Easy, Score: 4000, Time: 2:00/4:03
```

Short version would be:

```
[SPA] Singing Sin Documentos (Short) by Los Rodríguez - Difficulty: Easy, Score: 4000, Time: 2:00/4:03
```

When in Star Maker mode (nothing is tracked in this mode so this is a generic Rich Presence):

```
[SPA] In Star Maker mode
```

If in any other menu:

```
[SPA] Looking through menus
