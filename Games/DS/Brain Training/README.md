## Overview

Dr. Kawashima's Brain Training is a 2005 edutainment game for the Nintendo DS. It was released in Japan on May 19th 2005, and then later in the USA on April 16th 2006, and Europe on June 9th 2006. Test how fit your brain is and calculate its "Brain Age" using a test utilising three of six various minigames, then train it with nine other minigames, mostly involving drawing numbers and letters on the touch screen. Check in daily to unlock new minigames, or kick back with 120 sudoku puzzles on the side. The game also is one of the first to be played with the DS on its side.

Did you know this is the 4th best selling DS game of all time?

## Set Design

### Game Flow Description

The game begins with a one minigame Brain Age test, which is either the Stroop Test if you choose to use a microphone or a Calculations x20 if not. Afterwards, you'll be at the Calendar screen, where your options each day are to perform a Brain Age Check (which only stores the first result each day) and Training. Training consists of 9 minigames, and completing at least one a day earns you a stamp for that day. The stamp unlocks are as follows:

Stamps | Unlocks
--- | ---
 1  | Low To High Training
 2  | Syllable Count Training
 3  | Head Count Training
 5  | Tips section in Other Options
 7  | Stamp Designer mode in Other Options
 9  | Hard mode for Head Count
11  | Hard mode for Calculations x100
13  | Triangle Math Training
15  | Time Lapse Training
17  | Hard mode for Triangle Math
20  | Voice Calculation Training

Each day as well you'll also earn a tip from Dr. Kawashima right before you place your stamp. There's 23 tips in total and the 5 stamp reward gives you a page where you can see all of the ones you've unlocked up to that point.

The minigames that appear in the Brain Age Check mode are:
- Calculations x20 (it's virtually the same as the Training mode)
- Connect Maze
- Word Memory
- Number Cruncher
- Stroop Test (microphone only)
- Speed Counting (microphone only, although it doesn't really use it)

These minigames all have their own leaderboards and thus a score target to reach. Word Memory is the only one that's not timed and instead purely scored (and thus has a maximum score of 30). The others are all against the clock.

In Training mode, the minigames are:
- Calculations x20
- Calculations x100 (includes a hard mode that can be unlocked if you beat 90 seconds or collect 11 stamps)
- Reading Aloud
- Low To High
- Syllable Count
- Head Count (includes a hard mode that can be unlocked if you collect 9 stamps)
- Triangle Math (includes a hard mode that can be unlocked if you collect 11 stamps)
- Time Lapse
- Voice Calculation

Low To High and Head Count are the only two minigames with a score leaderboard instead of a time, so they have a maximum limit of 91 and 5 respectively. The others are time based (with penalties for wrong answers).

Back to the main menu, you can also access the Sudoku mode for each profile. The mode consists of three difficulties, each with four training puzzles that ask you to solve just the centre space, and then 36 full puzzles to solve. There's nothing at the end of it all otherwise.

### Achievements

#### Progression

There exists one achievement for each Stamp unlock to ensure that the player is playing along and unlocking all those modes.

#### Win Condition

Game completion is handled by the 20 stamp unlock.

#### Brain Age Check minigames

Ignoring Calculations x20 since it'll appear later, there are 5 minigames in this mode, each with a leaderboard and a goal achievement to target. These scores are self invented since there's no "Rocket Speed" ranking in the Brain Age Check minigames.

##### Connect Maze

The achievement requires this to be beaten in 50 seconds or less.

##### Word Memory

There's two achievements for this one:
- Finish with at least 22 words remembered.
- Finish with 30 words remembered.

The latter will only be worth 1 because it's very easy to screenshot or pause the game and write all the words down ahead of time, then recall them back, and while it's a bit of a challenge to then write them all back in, a normal player really trying probably won't get all 30. To that, getting at least 22 will earn the other one.

##### Number Cruncher

The achievement requires this to be beaten in 60 seconds or less.

##### Stroop Test

The achievement requires this to be beaten in 50 seconds or less.

##### Speed Counting

There's two achievements for this one:
- Finish in under 45 seconds.
- Finish in exactly 15 seconds.

The game properly uses frames (at 60 FPS) as its metric, but the presented number is always rounded down. The reason why there's two achievements is because the game doesn't even use the microphone for this one; it just asks you to press done when you're done, and the button is locked until exactly 15 seconds has passed. It really doesn't verify that you've done anything. Both will be very easy achievements, but for legitimacy there's a check that you've only tapped the screen once.

#### Training minigames

##### Calculations x20

The achievement requires this to be beaten in 12 seconds or less.

##### Calculations x100

There's two achievements for this one:
- Finish on Normal in under 65 seconds.
- Finish on Hard in under 65 seconds.

##### Reading Aloud

There's two achievements for this one:
- Finish with at least 12 syllables per second.
- Get told off for reading too fast.

Each page requires you to sit on it for at least 4 seconds before moving on to the next one, or else Dr. Kawashima will get upset. Similar to Speed Counting, the microphone isn't actually used, so doing well just involves clicking through correctly, so the achievements aren't worth much.

##### Low To High

There's two achievements for this one:
- Finish with at least 60 points.
- Finish with all 91 points.

Similar to Word Memory, this one requires a very superhuman ability to remember every number, although I'd say this one is more possible, so I'll permit getting both achievements at the same time. Still, the Rocket Speed score only requires 60, so I've got more emphasis on that one.

##### Syllable Count

The achievement requires this to be beaten in 60 seconds.

##### Head Count

There's two achievements for this one:
- Score all 5 points on Normal.
- Score all 5 points on Hard.

##### Triangle Math

There's two achievements for this one:
- Finish on Normal in under 30 seconds.
- Finish on Hard in under 30 seconds.

##### Time Lapse

The achievement requires this to be beaten in 40 seconds.

##### Voice Calculation

The achievement requires this to be beaten in 55 seconds.

#### Sudoku

Pretty straightforward, there's one achievement that corresponds to the four puzzles in each row of the menu. Tutorial puzzles will always equal 1 achievement point, four Basic puzzles are 2 points, four Intermediate puzzles are 3 points, and 4 Advanced puzzles are 5 points, totalling 93 points across 30 achievements.

#### Miscellaneous

Some extra things to achieve:
- Achieve a Brain Age of 20 in a 3 minigame test.
- Unlock all 23 tips.
- Remember a previously asked topic.
- Try your hand at some art.

### Leaderboards

Every minigame has a leaderboard, and on top of that there's one for the 3 minigame Brain Age.

### Rich Presence

Rich presence is as simple as checking the screen ID and determining what's going on. Many variables seem to only exist when contextually relevant so reliably tracking state in the rich presence is a bit tricky, but fortunately there's not much to track otherwise.
