## Overview

Dexter's Laboratory: Deesaster Strikes! is a 2001 action-adventure video game for the Game Boy Advance based on the Cartoon Network animated series Dexter's Laboratory. It was released in North America on September 26, 2001, and in the PAL region on November 2, 2001. Dexter's sister Dee Dee goes into Dexter's clone machine and creates dozens of copies of herself. Dexter has to catch all of the clones and fix all of the machines that they broke. While Dexter tries to catch all of the clones, he has to fight monsters and robots. There are 32 levels (Wikipedia cites an IGN article that claims there's 70 but that's totally wrong) and 8 worlds.

## Set Design

### Achievements

For all of these achievements, they will not trigger if the player has used a cheat or is in demo mode.

#### Progression

##### Dee Dees Rescued

Each of the four levels in each of the game's eight worlds contain four Dee Dees (except for Dexter's House C). There exists one achievement for collecting each Dee Dee in its corresponding level.

##### Machines Repaired

Each level has zero, one, or two machines to repair. There exists one achievement for repairing all the machines in its corresponding world.

##### Tools Acquired

To repair all the machines, there are six tools that must be collected across the game. There is an achievement when acquiring each one.

#### Game Completion

To complete the game, the player must interact with the machine in the Hub after collecting all the Dee Dees and repairing all the machines. There is no way to beat the game without this 100% completion.

#### Challenge

##### Robot Sweep

There is an achievement for each world (except Dexter's House as there are no enemies), the player must start the achievement by progressing from the Hub to the first level of the corresponding world, and then, without leaving the world (progressing back and forth between levels in a world is fine) or dying (lives decreasing), they must defeat each robot that can be defeated. Some robots are invincible and are not counted. Progression is measured and re-defeating the same robot does not further increment the measurement.

#### Miscellaneous

##### Collect 9 Lives

Pretty simple, just detect that the player has maxed out their lives at 9. Lives can only be acquired by picking up hearts throughout the game.

##### Complete Tutorial

This achievement is detected if the player reaches the end teleporter in the Tutorial after rescuing the Dee Dee and repairing the machine.

### Leaderboards

There is one leaderboard which submits your total in-game time when you trigger the end cutscene.

### Rich Presence

The rich presence lists your current level, lives, health, Dee Dees rescued, machines repaired, and your total in-game time. E.g.
