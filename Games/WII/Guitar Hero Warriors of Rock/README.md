## Overview

Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock was the final Guitar Hero release for the plastic-peripheral rhythm-game franchise, released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii in Europe on Sepmteber 24th, 2010, and the US on September 28th, 2010, forgoing the PlayStation 2 release just this one time. Like its predecessors, up to four players can play guitar, bass, drums, and vocals along to the setlist of 93 licensed songs (7 are just Rush's 2112, so it's only 87 if you want to count it like that), with no new hardware features of note on the controllers. New to this game are superpowers which are leveraged in the Career mode and Quickplay's Power Challenge mode, providing skilled players the ability to earn up to 40 stars on a song if they're good enough. Cheekily of note, the Expert+ difficulty for drums also introduces ghost notes which, inversely to accent notes, award extra points if the player plays them softly. The GHTunes feature returns unchanged from Guitar Hero 5, but the bonus challenges from Guitar Hero 5 have been applied to every instrument in Quickplay now. Otherwise, it's more Guitar Hero, for better or for worse.

## Set Design

### Game Flow Description

Comparing with my [Guitar Hero World Tour PS2 set](../../PS2/Guitar%20Hero%20World%20Tour/README.md), Warriors of Rock's progression is a lot more explicit, but there's also a tonne more challenges and modes on offer to compare against.

The Quest mode, like in Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero, is now unified no matter what instrument or how many players you have. Each of the eight characters in the career has a number of songs available to play, and after earning enough stars, you must play their encore song to continue on. After you clear the first four characters, you have to play through 2112, and then after the remaining four characters you have to play the three Megadeth songs in a row. From this point on, every song in the career now lets you play with all eight superpowers simultaneously, and your goal is to "dominate" the career by earning 40 stars in each song (except 2112, but the Megadeth songs re-appear in the super final tier of the Quest mode so you're expected to play those). Playing all 86 songs super well will award you with 40 stars, but it's a harder endeavour than the typical 5-star goal in Quickplay.

Annoyingly for Quickplay+ mode, you're not allowed to play 2112, Sudden Death, and every other non-Megadeth song from the final tier of Quest mode until they're available to play there, and there's no unlock song cheat, so you're gonna have to do Quest mode first. Afterwards, you can now play each of the 93 songs freely in this mode under the typical Guitar Hero rules. On top of that, every song has "Star Challenges", which extend GH5 and Band Hero's bonus challenge feature. Each challenge has a unique goal, whether as automatic as getting a certain score or streak with a certain instrument, or something more unique like hitting drums during sustains or alt strumming the entire song on guitar. These can be unlocked naturally when playing any song in Quickplay. On top of that, every song has a Power Challenge mode, which allows you to pick any two powers from Quest mode to try and go for the most stars possible. Different songs will have different highest possible stars, so there's a neat challenge in figuring out which powers are effective on the song, and which ones you're able to make the most of with your abilities. Also if you're good enough, a 100% on your instrument will award you with a 6th star, although unlike the Star Challenges, you don't need to be on a high difficulty level to achieve that.

Just like the previous games (or on the PS2, only World Tour), GHTunes and those MIDI songs return, this time with 11 on-disc songs to play to. They don't have vocals supported like they did in World Tour, and there's no bonus challenges, but they're still a number of songs to play along to.

Account-wide level ups and unlocks are purely every 10 Quickplay stars rather than time and money like it was in the GHWT-engine games. There's 104 levels with actual unlockables before the game just keeps the number going. Given how many achievements there are, you're naturally going to get these anyways so there's nothing too meaningful in tracking them for achievements. There's also an in-game achievement system, and that'll also be mostly ignored for this set. Most of the achievements are quest-based or multiplayer based, or they just have very particular requirements like finishing a song with exactly 133,337 points, which I don't see as particularly meaningful to track for an achievement.

To go a bit overkill, there are 606 songs that can also be added to the game via DLC to play in Quickplay+ mode.

Source | Number of Songs
--- | ---
Band Hero | 61
GH: Metallica | 39
GH: Smash Hits | 21
GH: World Tour | 35
GH5 | 69
GHWT DLC | 144
GH5 DLC | 160
GHWoR DLC | 77

If you're curious about these particular numbers compared to Wikipedia:
- The per-game imports are the same across all platforms. It's a bit sad that not every song can be imported, and especially surprising how much of World Tour and Smash Hits can't be imported.
	- Wikipedia notes 37 songs are importable for Guitar Hero World Tour but 2 of those are the guitar duels which are counted in the GHWT DLC category.
- World Tour had 158 DLC songs total, but the 6 Jimi Hendrix tracks are explicitly only allowed to be played in GHWT, so we're missing:
	- "If 6 Was 9" by Jimi Hendrix
	- "Little Wing" by Jimi Hendrix
	- "Fire (Live at Woodstock)" by Jimi Hendrix
	- "Freedom" by Jimi Hendrix
	- "Angel" by Jimi Hendrix
	- "Foxy Lady (Live at Woodstock)" by Jimi Hendrix
- As a curious note for the Wii in particular, from the launch Metallica Death Magnetic DLC, only Broken, Beat & Scarred, Cyanide, and My Apocalypse were available as DLCs on the Wii (maybe due to their length?). The three songs appeared in both the PS2 and Wii versions of Guitar Hero Metallica as bonuses at the end of the setlist. For Guitar Hero 5, all 11 tracks were available as DLC just like the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, so the 8 missing tracks are counted for GH5 DLC instead of GHWT DLC here.
- For note, GHWT did not have the Expert+ difficulty for drums, but 26 of the songs (which includes 7 of the 8 missing Death Magnetic songs) had them added in when played in GH5 and GHWoR.
- GH5 had 164 DLCs total, the Wii is missing:
	- The Neversoft Thanks the Fans Track Pack (which was free), so we're missing the 6 songs:
		- "Lemon Frosting" by Bunny Knutson
		- "RockNRola" by Nancy Fullforce
		- "From the Blue/Point of No Return/T.T.R.T.S" by An Endless Sporadic
			- Yet amazingly The Triangular Race Through Space is the credits song to this game. 🤔
		- "Love Holds It Down" by Dom Liberati
		- "You Really Like Me" by Davidicus
		- "Guilty Pleasures" by Tony Solis
	- The Steve Ouimette songs (which also were free), so we're missing 6 more songs:
		- "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" by Steve Ouimette
		- "God Save the Queen" by Steve Ouimette
		- "Il Canto degli Italiani" by Steve Ouimette
		- "La Marseillaise" by Steve Ouimette
		- "Lied der Deutschen" by Steve Ouimette
		- "The Star-Spangled Banner" by Steve Ouimette
- Warriors of Rock had 84 DLCs. The Wii is missing:
	- The Rocktober Track Pack was only released on the Xbox 360, missing the 3 songs:
		- "The Infection" by Disturbed
		- "Na Na Na" by My Chemical Romance
		- "Resistence" by Muse
	- "Rock and Roll All Nite" in the KISS-mas Track Pack is actually a reused chart from Smash Hits, and won't re-appear in your library, so it's excluded.
	- The final pack, the Darkest Hour Track Pack, was never released on the Wii, missing the 3 songs:
		- "Savor the Kill" by Darkest Hour
		- "Beyond the Life You Know" by Darkest Hour
		- "Doomsayer" by Darkest Hour

There's a couple of special case DLCs as well to consider:
- "Suicide & Redemption" has two versions with two different guitar solos. They both have identical drum and bass parts (and no vocal part) so some special logic has been implemented to merge these two.
- "Sweet Home Alabama (Live)" was available both as an export song from GHWT and in the Classic Rock 3 Track Pack for GH5. Both have the exact same charts for all four instruments and thus can be merged with special logic.

Every DLC song has the exact same Star Challenges, and the targets are all calculations based on the charts, so the game doesn't set out any special challenge for any DLC song. However, we can still come up with a target for the Power Challenge mode.

The Roadie Play mode is a multiplayer-only mode exclusive to the Wii version where extra people with DSs can throw power-ups into the mix. It's a purely competitive multiplayer mode, so there's no need to cover it.

### Achievements (core)

#### Progression

The Quest mode is the clear bit of progression. There's one achievement for clearing the encore of each of the eight characters, plus one achievement for clearing 2112 since that's required along the way.

#### Win Condition

Clearing the Megadeth chapter of the game is the definite end of the game. There's an extra in-game achievement after clearing the first two songs of this tier, but there's no reason to mimic that for RetroAchievements since there's only one song left in the game (and there's enough achievements as there is).

#### Per Song

After clearing Quest mode, your goal is to dominate every song and achieve 40 stars. There's one achievement for doing this as a solo player on any difficulty (except Beginner) on each song, which means 86 achievements total (since all seven parts of 2112 are excluded from this).

In Quickplay+ mode, there's one achievement for achieving five stars on each available instrument on each song on Expert difficulty (or Expert+ on drums if available). ~~There's also another achievement for each available instrument for achieving all of the Star Challenge goals for that instrument on that song.~~ (this is currently unsupported by the RA logic, but I do want to support this eventually). ~~Finally, there's a target star count for the Power Challenge on each song that must be achieved on Expert on any instrument (Expert+ is available, but Expert is supported for drums as well)~~ (this could be in the Power Challenge subset). Thus to calculate this, we have:

- 84 songs with 5 achievements (dominate Quest mode, five-star on each of the four instruments, ~~achieve all the Challenge goals with all four instruments, achieve the target stars in Power Challenge mode~~).
- 2 songs with 4 achievements ("Black Widow of La Porte" and "Speeding (Vault Version)" don't have vocals, but otherwise are the same as above)
- 6 songs with 4 achievements (2112 doesn't have the Quest mode achievement, otherwise the same)
- 1 song with 2 achievements (2112 Pt. 3 doesn't have the Quest mode achievement, and only has Guitar and Vocals)

This totals 454 achievements just for the songs alone!

### Custom Songs

There's 11 GHTunes songs, each with guitar, bass, and drum parts, so, again, there's an achievement for 5-starring each one on Expert difficulty, totalling 33 achievements. For note, GHTunes doesn't support Expert+ on drums.

#### Miscellaneous

You know we've got to do a few of these as well:
- Get six stars (and a score of at least 50,000) on any song on Hard or higher difficulty in Quickplay+.
- Create your own GHTunes song with over 500 notes on any instrument and then five-star that part on Expert.
- Earn the following star counts in Quickplay+ mode:
	- 100
	- 500
	- 1,000
	- 2,000
	- 3,300 (this is the last one with unlocks)
- Five star the following songs with the chosen instrument and vocals, both on Expert difficulty:
	- Black Rain (Guitar)
	- Burnin' For You (Guitar)
	- Chemical Warfare (Bass)
	- Cherry Bomb (Guitar)
	- Dance, Dance (Guitar)
	- Fortunate Son (Guitar)
	- Free Ride (Guitar)
	- Get Free (Guitar)
	- Holy Wars (Guitar)
	- How You Remind Me (Guitar)
	- I Know What I Am (Bass)
	- If You Want Peace Prepare For War (Guitar)
	- It's Only Another Parsec (Guitar)
	- Listen To Her Heart (Guitar)
	- Love Gun (Guitar)
	- Lunatic Fringe (Guitar)
	- Machinehead (Guitar)
	- Money For Nothing (Guitar)
	- Motivation (Guitar)
	- Move It On Over (Guitar)
	- No Way Back (Guitar)
	- Rockin' in the Free World (Guitar)
	- Savior (Guitar)
	- Scumbag Blues (Guitar)
	- Self Esteem (Guitar)
	- Seven Nation Army (Guitar)
	- Sharp Dressed Man (Guitar)
	- Slow Hands (Guitar)
	- Suffocated (Guitar)
	- There's No Secrets This Year (Guitar)
	- This Day We Fight (Guitar)
	- 2112 Pt. 2 (Bass)
	- 2112 Pt. 4 (Bass)
	- Uprising (Guitar)
	- What Do I Get (Guitar)
	- Wish (Guitar)
	- (You Can Still) Rock In America (Bass)

For reference, I've skipped these songs for these reasons:
	- Aqualung (Guitar)
		- This one's a maybe because Ian only plays guitar during the slower bridge.
	- Bohemian Rhapsody (Guitar)
		- Maybe with the all taps cheat on?
	- Fascination Street (Guitar)
		- Maybe not because the rhythm guitar kicks in while Robert's singing.
	- Renegade (Guitar)
		- Tommy is rhythm on this one and most of the chart is lead
	- Sudden Death (Guitar)
		- This song is hard enough as it is, plus we've already got two Megadeth songs in the mix.
	- Ties That Bind (Guitar)
		- Myles only does rhythm on this one
	- 2112 Pt. 1 (Bass)
		- There's barely any vocals
	- 2112 Pt. 5 (Bass)
		- The vocals are often at a time there's no bass part and vice versa
	- 2112 Pt. 6 (Bass)
		- The vocals are often at a time there's no bass part and vice versa
	- 2112 Pt. 7 (Bass)
		- There's barely any vocals

### Leaderboards

Every song in Quickplay+, ~~Power Challenge,~~ and Quest mode will have a leaderboard for each instrument (all difficulties are consolidated into one leaderboard). For Power Challenges, there's two leaderboards, one for the number of stars earned, and one for the score output (since some people may want to challenge on either). In Quest mode, leaderboards will only be available on repeatable scenarios, so you won't get leaderboards for most of the songs until you're returning with all the powers active. Each part of 2112 will be handled specially since you can only play them with the four powers available at that point in the game (even if you return to it), and "Holy Wars" and "This Day We Fight" in the specific chapter will also have a specially handled version since the player can repeat the four-power mode for those two songs. "Sudden Death" has eight powers in both this chapter as well as the dominate mode, so there's no reason to support it differently for both versions.

So to sum them up:
- 
- 88 songs with 8 leaderboards
- 2 songs with 12 leaderboards ("Holy Wars" and "This Day We Fight" has the repeatable four-challenge variant in Quest mode, and they also have Expert+ drums)
- 2 songs with 6 leaderboards ("Black Widow of La Porte" and "Speeding (Vault Version)" don't have vocals but they do have Expert+ drums)
- 1 song with 4 leaderboards (2112 Pt. 3 only has Guitar and Vocals)

Every Voxtar challenge also has its own leaderboard which is another 37 leaderboards.

Each GHTunes song also will get the standard three leaderboards for each of the three instruments on each of the four difficulties, so that's 33 extra leaderboards.

Finally, the number of profile stars will also be a leaderboard and submits after every song in Quickplay+ mode. This totals to 815 leaderboards.

### Rich Presence

The Rich Presence follows this structure:

```
[EG|MB|X+D|HV] - Quest mode, Song: Again, Score: 123,456, Streak: 502
```

The first section indicates what difficulty and instruments are currently active, so a completely inactive band will be `[--|--|--|--]`. The mode is then listed (whether it be Quest mode, Competitive mode, Quickplay+, Power Challenge, GHTunes, Practice mode, or Party Play), and then the song details are listed with the score and streak.

If cheats are active or the player has paused too many times, the Rich Presence will change to:

```
[EG|MB|X+D|HV] [CHEATS ON] [PAUSE SPAM] - Quest mode, Song: Again, Score: 123,456, Streak: 502
```

Finally when between songs, the following Rich Presence will display:

```
[EG|MB|X+D|HV] - Getting ready to rock, Profile Stars: 1,500
```
