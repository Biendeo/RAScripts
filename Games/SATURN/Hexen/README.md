## Overview

Hexen is a 1995 first-person shooter video game for DOS, with a Nintendo 64, Sony PlayStation, and Sega Saturn port releasing in March 1997. The sequel to the DOS only Heretic, this game also runs on the Doom engine, but with some additional features: the ability to jump and look up and down, an inventory system, three playable classes with unique weapons, non-linear hubs involving backtracking to previous levels, polyobjects that can move horizontally as well as vertically and a scripting system known as ACScript which allows for complex level behaviour and effects.

## Set Design

### Game Flow Description

The game consists of five hubs, each ending in an FMV intermission sequence before progressing to the next hub. Hubs consist of 6 (or 7 in the case of hub 3) maps, and involve discovering and solving the puzzles and key-hunting to unlock the pathway to the exit. Each level contains a custom amount of items to pick up, although for the most part, whenever there's an item other than a Flechette, Quartz Flask, or Disc of Repulsion, there's only ever one of it in that level. Half the time those items are intended to be secrets as well.

### Achievements

Usually I have a great structure to the achievements but this one's pretty free-form. Different maps have different switches that do different things, and there's no particular pattern to any of it, so I'll just generally describe what's going on.

#### Progression

For the most part most of the switches are required to beat the game, so any achievement marked as `Progression` is something that's needed to continue. Most first players won't realise the Seven Portals ends once you've pulled the switches in the centre of the map after two trips to each level, so everything with that hub afterwards is missable. Otherwise, all the keys, key items, and random switches, as well as the maps you definitely need to go to will be marked correctly.

#### Game Completion

The final boss is the clear end game goal.

#### Miscellaneous

Most levels have unique items that can be picked up. I generally went with achievements (they're all marked as `Missable`) which weren't directly in the path of the player. Sometimes they're decently hidden in walls and are worth more, sometimes they're just in a side room and are a lot easier to accidentally discover. As long as it's not literally in front of another required step (e.g. the Falcon Shield in front of the ONE THIRD switch in the Guardian of Fire), I put an achievement for it.

Otherwise, picking up each weapon is a non-missable non-map-specific achievement as well. You have to go out of your way to somehow beat the game without that, and there's the ability to get them even after visiting the final hub, so you can't get too caught out there.

There's also an extra one for ringing the bell in the first level without picking up the Silver Key. It's a fun little extra challenge, but I didn't want the player to play through the game multiple times (it really isn't that much different with them).

### Leaderboards

There are no leaderboards for this set.

### Rich Presence

If you're on the main menu you'll get this RP:

```
Entering the realm of Hexen
```

Otherwise it'll be in this format indicating what class, map, difficulty, health, mana, and time (as well as cheats) you have:

```
Baratus the Fighter is in the Seven Portals on skill level Berserker, üíñ: 100, üîµ: 150, üü¢: 50, ‚è±Ô∏è: 0h30m [CHEATS ACTIVE] [Noclip | God]
```
