## Overview

Singstar Party is a 2004 music video game for the PlayStation 2 and the second title in the Singstar franchise. It was released in PAL regions on September 23rd, 2004 (four months after the first game), and never released in North America. Sing along to 30 more songs that span a variety of genres and time periods using the two bundled Singstar microphones and USB dongle. The career mode of the first game is gone, but there exists more party mode options, including some songs with duet options. Again, this achievement set will only focus on the single-player scenarios.

## Set Design

### Game Flow Description

Without a career mode, this set is actually straightforward; players sing the songs in Sing Solo mode. There's no extra modes for single player, and other than a duet mode, I don't see any need for anything else in this game.

### Achievements

#### Progression

Every Easy score achievement is marked for progression, as there's no other way to really ask that the player has beaten a game.

#### Win Condition

There's no explicit win condition, the progression achievements should cover "beating" the game.

#### Per Song

Each of the game's 30 songs has three (or four) achievements:
- Beating the easy score on any difficulty.
- Beating the hard score on the hard difficulty (which is **always** 540 points less).
- Getting a phrase bonus on 75% (rounded up) of the song's phrases on each of the song parts (six of the songs have two parts so they're treated separately).
    - A phrase bonus is acquired when the player gets a cool rated phrase while their star bar is at least 80% full, and the player will get phrase bonus points for doing so.

#### Miscellaneous

There exist a few extra achievements:
- Turn on the Eyetoy camera and get 10 Golden Note phrases.
- Achieve a score of 9000 on any song on hard (10 points).

### Leaderboards

There are six leaderboards per song and part, one for combination of difficulty and short/normal length. Ain't No Sunshine doesn't have a short version so it only has three. This equates to 213 leaderboards total.

### Rich Presence

The rich presence when in a song in Sing Solo Mode displays to the following format:

```
Solo Mode: This Love by Maroon5 - Difficulty: Easy, Score: 4000, Time: 2:00/3:47
```

There's also Freestyle Mode which doesn't have points or difficulty:

```
Freestyle Mode: This Love by Maroon5 - Time: 2:00/3:47
```

And there's some Party Mode tracking in case you're in that mode:
```
Pass The Mic Mode: Blue 3 vs. Red 2
```

```
Party Mode: This Love by Maroon5 - Difficulty: Easy, Score: 4000, Time: 2:00/3:47
```

Also if you've switched the disc there's a generic RP to highlight that:
