# Biendeo's RAScripts

This is a repository storing all of my RAScript files and additional scripts relating to building [RetroAchievements](http://www.retroachievements.org/) sets!

Please view the corresponding `Games` for more information.

## Setup

- RAScript files require [RATools](https://github.com/Jamiras/RATools/releases) to interpret.
- Python scripts run in their directory using Python 3.11 (`winget install Python.Python.3.11`).
	- All dependencies are in `requirements.txt`, install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
