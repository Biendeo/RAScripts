## Overview

Singstar Party is a 2004 music video game for the PlayStation 2. It was released in PAL regions on May 21st, 2004, but was never released in North America. Just like Singstar, the French (titled Singstar NRJ Tour there), German, Italian, and Spanish versions contain some slightly different track listings featuring various non-English artists and songs. In total there are 55 songs found in these versions not in the English release.

## Set Design

### Achievements

#### Progression and Win Condition

This is a subset so there's no special achievement tags.

#### Per Song

Each of the 55 songs has three (or four) achievements:
- Beating the easy score on any difficulty.
- Beating the hard score on the hard difficulty (which is **always** 540 points less).
- Getting a phrase bonus on 75% (rounded up) of the song's phrases on each of the song parts (seven of the songs have two parts so they're treated separately).
    - A phrase bonus is acquired when the player gets a cool rated phrase while their star bar is at least 80% full, and the player will get phrase bonus points for doing so.

### Leaderboards

There are six leaderboards per song and part, one for combination of difficulty and short/normal length. This equates to 372 leaderboards total.

### Rich Presence

The rich presence when in a song in Sing Solo Mode displays to the following format:

```
[FRA] Solo Mode: This Love by Maroon5 - Difficulty: Easy, Score: 4000, Time: 2:00/3:47
```

There's also Freestyle Mode which doesn't have points or difficulty:

```
[FRA] Freestyle Mode: This Love by Maroon5 - Time: 2:00/3:47
```

And there's some Party Mode tracking in case you're in that mode:
```
[FRA] Pass The Mic Mode: Blue 3 vs. Red 2
```

```
[FRA] Party Mode: This Love by Maroon5 - Difficulty: Easy, Score: 4000, Time: 2:00/3:47
```

Also if you've switched the disc there's a generic RP to highlight that:

```
[FRA] Singing with a different disc
```

Otherwise if you're in any other menu:

```
[FRA] Looking through menus
```

And if the disc cannot be determined at first, you get:
```
Booting up...
