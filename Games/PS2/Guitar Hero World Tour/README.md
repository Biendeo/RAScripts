## Overview

Guitar Hero: World Tour is a 2008 music video game for the PlayStation 2. It was released in the US on October 26th, 2008, Europe on November 14th, 2008 (the Wii and Xbox 360 versions were November 7th), and Australia on November 12th, 2008. It's the sixth entry in the Guitar Hero franchise, and new to the game is allowing players to play as the whole band, introducing a new drum kit accessory with three pads and two rubber cymbals, and a Logitech microphone. Players can also still play guitar and bass parts using the existing controllers, but new controllers included a touch strip underneath the frets which allows the player to strum by touching the strip anywhere, or during special purple note sections, slide across the touch strip to hit the notes if they came over. This touch strip feature is very hard to master though, so it's just recommend to play the notes as if they're hammer-ons using the frets (albeit without needing to strum any notes before). Play across 86 licensed songs, compete in 2 guitar duels with Zakk Wylde and Ted Nugent, and create your own songs using the GHTunes feature.

## Set Design

### Game Flow Description

The game contains five separate career modes following each of the four instruments (guitar, bass, drums, and vocals) and a band mode (which is any combination of two or players for multiplayer). Each career mode consists of 18 gigs covering all of the game's 86 songs (although only the guitar career contains the two guitar duel tracks, and the vocals career doesn't include Satch Boogie which has no vocals). Players work their way through the gigs to unlock songs and acquire stars, which will unlock more gigs. Some gigs also cost money to unlock, but fortunately plenty of money is awarded to players per song so this should be no issue. Money is also used to unlock character customisation features such as hairstyles, clothes, and instruments.

### Achievements

#### Progression

There are no progression achievements as every career is independent, and each one contains a win condition at the end. If it weren't for that though, every gig in the game for all four instrument careers (band not included) has two achievements; one for clearing every song in one session on at least Easy (Beginner is too easy to count), and another for all on Expert only.

#### Win Condition

Each career's "Complete Gig At Time's Square" achievement is a win condition, as beating this gig plays the game's credits. Technically leaving a gig or beating any song on Beginner can result in the player not unlocking this achievement until they go back and re-play the gig. This is just because the achievement logic couldn't use the game's persisted state easily, so instead it tries to detect the player actively doing each song in one session.

#### Per Song

Every song in the game contains an achievement for getting five stars on each instrument available (which means only three achievements for Satch Boogie and only one for both guitar duels).

#### Custom Songs

Each of the 17 on-disc custom songs also has a five-star achievement for guitar, bass, and drums. The vocals is quite odd on these so the player only has to play one song on expert for a miscellaneous achievement.

#### Dual Instrument

The following songs also include a special achievement where the player must play both the chosen instrument and vocals on Expert difficulty and achieve five stars:
- About A Girl (Unplugged) (Guitar)
- Band on the Run (Bass)
- Demolition Man Live (Bass)
- Everlong (Guitar)
- Hotel California (Drums)
- Overkill (Bass)
- Purple Haze (Live) (Guitar)
- Stillborn (Guitar)
- Today (Guitar)
- Trapped Under Ice (Guitar)
- The Wind Cries Mary (Guitar)

#### Rocker Rank

As the player earns money, they'll upgrade their Rocker Rank. There are 50 main rank icons in the game, and once the player reaches 51 at 1 million dollars, they sort-of sit there until 2 million dollars where they'll suddenly get to rank 101. This repeats for ranks 151, 201, and 251. There exists one achievement for each Rocker Rank up to and including 51.

#### Miscellaneous

There exists a few one

### Leaderboards

Every song contains a leaderboard for each instrument for each difficulty (excluding Beginner). Custom songs also contain a leaderboard for guitar, bass, and drums on each non-Beginner difficulty. Each Dual Instrument achievement also has a corresponding leaderboard.
